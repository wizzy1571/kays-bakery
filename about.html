    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      Kay’s Bakery is a family owned business built on love, tradition, and a passion for baking.
      We started from a small kitchen and grew into a trusted brand known for our soft bread, rich cakes, and customer first service.

      Our goal is to bring joy to every home, one slice at a time.
      Whether it's a birthday, wedding, or just your morning tea, we’ve got the perfect treat for you.
